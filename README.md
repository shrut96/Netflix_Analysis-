Inferences and Conclusion
I tried to Analyze the Netflix Data through the Netflix Dataset which i got from Kaggle.com. It wasn't easy for me, as a beginner, to do the analysis and various sources were helpful like Jovian.ml Forum, Google.com, and Python library documentations. In the process I realised it to be a tough yet fun task to analyze such cool datasets and would be happy to look forward in the field of Data Science/ Data Analysis. We concluded many results throught the analysis like-

1. Netflix has more number of Movies than TV Shows.
2. Netflix has the most number of Titles released in the year 2018.
We got to know the top 5 most popular ratings, top 5 countries producing most number of titles, top 5 year when Netflix produced most number of Titles and also the 5 least popular genre on Netflix.

I have created dashboard using IBM Cognoos Analytics.
